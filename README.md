# BBL-uCore: uCore OS Labs on Berkeley Boot Loader

bbl-ucore is a porting of [ucore_os_lab](https://github.com/chyyuu/ucore_os_lab.git) to RISC-V architecture. It's built on top of the Berkeley Boot Loader, [`bbl`](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pk.git), a supervisor execution environment for tethered RISC-V systems.

## Building

You'll need [riscv-tools](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tools.git) to build this project.
